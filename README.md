I developed a comprehensive web-based loan default prediction system using a variety of modern technologies and methodologies. My goal was to create an application that could accurately predict whether a loan would default based on various input features. The system comprises several key components, each playing a vital role in its functionality.

## Backend Development with FastAPI
1.	FastAPI Framework: I chose FastAPI for the backend development due to its high performance and ease of use. It allowed me to create robust API endpoints efficiently.
2.	Data Model with Pydantic: I used the Pydantic library to define a LoanPredictionInput class, ensuring that the input data for the prediction model was structured and type-safe.
3.	Predictive Model Integration: The core of the backend is a machine learning model, which I integrated into the FastAPI application. This model is invoked when the /predict_loan_default endpoint is hit.
   
## Frontend Interface
1.	HTML and JavaScript: For the frontend, I crafted an HTML page complemented by JavaScript. This interface provides users with a form to input the required data for the loan default prediction.
2.	CSS for Styling: I ensured the form was not only functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing using CSS. Particular attention was paid to making the design responsive for different device screens.
   
## Deployment with Docker
1.	Containerization: To streamline deployment, I containerized the application using Docker. I wrote a Dockerfile that outlined the steps to create a Docker image of the application.
2.	Consistency Across Environments: By using Docker, I guaranteed that the application would run identically in different environments, be it development, staging, or production.
   
## Creating the Dockerfile
4.	Base Image: I started by selecting an appropriate base image. For a Python-based application like mine, an image like python:3.8-slim is a suitable choice because it's lightweight yet contains all the necessary Python dependencies.
   
6.	Environment Setup: The Dockerfile includes commands to set up the environment. This involves updating the package list, installing necessary system dependencies, and setting up a non-root user for security purposes.
   
8.	Dependencies Installation: I used the COPY command to transfer the requirements.txt file into the container and then ran pip install to install the Python dependencies specified in that file.
   
10.	Copying Application Code: The next step was to copy the application source code into the container. This includes all my FastAPI application files, the HTML and JavaScript files for the frontend, and the trained machine learning model.
    
11.	Exposing Ports and Setting the Command: I specified which port the application should run on within the container using the EXPOSE command. The CMD command was used to define the command that runs the application, typically starting the FastAPI server using Uvicorn.

## Additional Project Components
1.	Requirements File: I maintained a requirements.txt file to keep track of all Python dependencies, ensuring reproducibility and ease of setup in different environments.
2.	Model and Data Management: The machine learning model, stored as default.pkl, was a pivotal component. It was trained on historical loan data to make accurate predictions.
   
## Project Workflow
•	Data Handling: When a user submits the form on the frontend, the data is sent to the FastAPI backend, where it's processed and fed into the machine learning model.
•	Response and Interaction: The model predicts whether a loan is likely to default, and this prediction is sent back to the user interface, displaying the result to the user.

## Testing and Deployment
•	Testing the Docker Container: Before deploying, I rigorously tested the Docker container to ensure everything functioned correctly.
•	Deployment to Production: Once satisfied with the testing, I deployed the Docker container to a production server, making the application live and accessible.

## Conclusion
Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to integrate machine learning, backend and frontend development, and modern deployment techniques. This application serves as a practical tool in the financial sector, showcasing a full-stack AI solution's potential.
